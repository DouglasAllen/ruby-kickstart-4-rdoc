=== Putting it all together

  # We've seen a lot of things we can do with method parameters.
  # But how do they all work together?
  def meth(ordinal, optional=true, *variable_length, &block)
  end

  # Probably you don't need to use them all in one method like this,
  # it is up to you to find the right fit for your use case :).
