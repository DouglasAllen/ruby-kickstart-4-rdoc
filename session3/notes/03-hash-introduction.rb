=== Hash Introsuction  
  
  # A hash table is a data structure that allows you to keep track of
  # data in key / value pairs.
  #
  # Where arrays access elements by their index, hashes access
  # elements by their keys, and a key can be any object.
  #
  # Hashes are very fast, with near constant time to look up an element.
