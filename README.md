Getting these files ready for rdoc and yard
==================================

$ rdoc

[Rdoc](https://github.com/rdoc/rdoc)

[Ruby Standard Library and core](http://rubydoc.info/stdlib)

As an update the link above is a temp holding area for this experiment.

It's not Rdoc though. It's markdown converted to markup.
